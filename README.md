## Problem Statement
Sex education is often inadequate or non-existent in many educational systems worldwide, leading to negative outcomes such as unplanned pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and misunderstandings about sexual health and relationships. There's a significant gap in accessible, comprehensive, and non-judgmental sex education resources, especially for young people.

## Our Solution
SexEdu aims to fill this gap by providing a digital platform offering accurate, inclusive, and age-appropriate sex education resources. It addresses topics such as reproductive health, contraception, consent, healthy relationships, and LGBTQ+ issues, promoting SDGs 3, 4, 5, and 10.

SexEdu provides a range of features to support its mission, including:

1. **Educational Modules**: Interactive modules covering various aspects of sexual health and relationships tailored for different age groups, promoting SDG 4 - Quality Education.

2. **Q&A Section**: A confidential Q&A section where users can ask questions anonymously and receive accurate information from trained professionals, promoting SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-being.

3. **Community Forum**: A safe and inclusive community forum for users to discuss topics related to sexual health, share experiences, and offer support, promoting SDG 5 - Gender Equality and SDG 10 - Reduced Inequalities.

4. **Interactive Quizzes**: Engaging quizzes to reinforce learning and knowledge retention in a fun way.

5. **Resource Library**: A comprehensive library of articles, videos, and other resources covering a wide range of sexual health topics.
